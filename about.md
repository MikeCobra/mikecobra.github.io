My name is Mike Clarke (MikeCobra) and I was a Java Developer before turning to the dark side and becoming an Operations Engineer.

I am interested in applying development practices to the infrastructure world by means of Configuration Management, Infrastructure as Code and other terms overused at conferences. At the same time, I try and make sure traditional Ops practices such as "not breaking everything" are followed and dealing with issues such as "having too much to do".
