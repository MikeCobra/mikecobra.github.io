My name is Mike Clarke (MikeCobra) and I was a Java Developer before turning to
the dark side and becoming an Operations Engineer.

I am interested in applying development practices to the infrastructure world by
means of Configuration Management, Infrastructure as Code and other terms
overused at conferences. At the same time, I try and make sure traditional Ops
practices such as "not breaking everything" are followed and dealing with issues
such as "having too much to do".

In my spare time, I play video games
(notably [Minecraft](http://minecraft.mikecobra.co.uk) and
[League of Legends](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/20240027)), drink wine
and play board games and card games (notably A Game of Thrones LCG).
